# MovieDataBase
Marvel MovieDataBase my project is movie database based on mArvel movies. I picked this topic because I Love movies and wanted a way to binge watch Marvel movies. With this database you can choose to watch all movies ex. would be to watch all "Iron Man Movies" or what ever film you choose. You can delete a movie and add another "Marvel Movie"

Group 1: 1)Write a  SELECT query that utilizes an ORDER BY clause. 2) Write a  SELECT query that filters NULL rows using IS NOT NULL.

Group 2: Write a DML statement that DELETEs a set of rows with a WHERE clause. The values used in the WHERE clause should be a variable.

Group 3: Design a NONCLUSTERED INDEX with ONE KEY COLUMN that improves the performance of one of the above queries.
